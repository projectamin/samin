# samin

The same as Amin but different.

Samin is developed using swift - for toolchain installation and setup please refer to: 

https://swift.org/getting-started/

To build samin from source please try one of the following:

`amin -u samin.xml`

This will pull the toolchain into a temporary location and compile samin.

If you wish to do so using standard swift tooling - after setting up your toolchain via the above link you can run the following in the project root. 

`swift build`
